👋 Hi, I’m @CU-OGL!
We’re interested in developing our coding capabilities and workflows in a centralized and sustainable manner- particularly for high-throughput lipidomics but also in paleoclimate studies!

🙏 Many of us are begginners on coding and git journeys, and therefore this space is a work in progress. Constructive feedback welcomed 😀

📫 How to reach me: current contact is Harry Allbrook, a graduate student in the CU OGL who is establishing this github account.
