👋 Hi, I’m @CU-OGL!
We’re interested in developing our coding capabilities and workflows in a centralized and sustainable manner- particularly for high-throughput lipidomics!

🙏 Many of us are begginners on coding journeys, and therefore this space is a work in progress. Constructive feedback welcomed 😀

📫 How to reach me: currently contact Harry Allbrook, member of CU OGL who is establishing this github account.

⚡ Pun fact: What's Harry's favourite intramolecular force?

😲 LONDON forces!
